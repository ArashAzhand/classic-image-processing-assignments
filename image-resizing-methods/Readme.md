##  Methods Implemented

- Nearest Neighbor
- Bilinear Interpolation
- Chessboard Interpolation
- City Block Interpolation
- Euclidean Interpolation
- My method (Lanczos)

##  Sample Results

Resize results were compared using PSNR to evaluate quality differences between methods, for scaling up scenario.
