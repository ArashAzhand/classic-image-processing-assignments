# Adaptive Median Filtering for Salt & Pepper Noise Removal

This project presents an enhanced median filtering approach to remove salt & pepper noise from grayscale images. The method adapts the kernel size and applies the filter iteratively to maximize denoising quality.

##  Method Description

### Problem:
Standard median filters work well on low-noise images, but at high noise densities (e.g., 70%â€“90%), fixed-size kernels fail to restore detail while removing all noise.

### Proposed Adaptive Method:
- **Step 1:** Iterate over every pixel.
- **Step 2:** Check if pixel value is 0 or 255 (noisy).
  - If **not noisy**, keep original value.
  - If **noisy**, apply median filter over a dynamic kernel.
- **Step 3:** Loop over increasing kernel sizes from `3x3` to `21x21` to find the best PSNR.
- **Step 4:** Repeat the process until no more salt/pepper pixels are left or a max iteration limit is reached to avoid infinite loops.

This allows the method to:
- Adapt kernel size to local noise conditions
- Perform **aggressive filtering** only where needed
- Outperform traditional median filters at high noise densities

> Result: The adaptive approach consistently improves PSNR by a wide margin, especially under high-noise conditions.
