# Retinal Vessel Segmentation using Classical Image Processing (DRIVE Dataset)

This project presents a classical image processing pipeline to extract blood vessels from retinal images using the DRIVE dataset. The method avoids deep learning models and instead relies on a carefully designed sequence of enhancement and segmentation techniques.

##  Processing Pipeline

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Green Channel Extraction**
The green channel is selected from the RGB image because it provides the best contrast between the retinal background and the blood vessels.

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Inverse Log Transformation**
To restore original intensity values and enhance contrast, a reverse logarithmic transformation is applied to the green channel.

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Noise Reduction**
A bilateral filter is used to smooth the image while preserving edges (especially useful for keeping vessel boundaries intact).

### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Unsharp Masking**
High-frequency components are extracted and added back to the image to enhance edges and fine vessel structures.

### ðŸ”¹ 5. **Contrast Enhancement**
Adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) is applied to improve local contrast and better distinguish vessels from background tissue.

### ðŸ”¹ 6. **Adaptive Thresholding**
A local thresholding technique is used to binarize the image and segment vessels based on enhanced contrast patterns.

### ðŸ”¹ 7. **Region of Interest Masking**
To remove irrelevant parts of the image (like the bright border around the retina), the provided binary mask is eroded and applied to the vessel image.

## Evaluation Metrics

For each test image, the segmented result is compared to the expert annotation using the following metrics:

- **Sensitivity** (True Positive Rate)
- **Specificity** (True Negative Rate)
- **Accuracy** (Overall Pixel Classification Correctness)
